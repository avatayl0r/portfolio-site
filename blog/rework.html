      <p>ava-taylor.com has been a big ongoing project I've been working on in my spare time. I have built it using JavaScript, NodeJS, ThreeJS, HTML, and CSS.</p>
      <p>This site is purposed to showcase my work, keeping track of a general employment and skills history, a bit about me in general, and a blog for blogging my various development projects.</p>
      <p>I have plans to add a games section for my games development projects, tools for my tools, and a gallery of my 3D models, texturing, materials, shaders, and more.</p>
      <p>Whilst building the site I noticed a lot of the HTML could (and should) be automatically generated based on prompt information. This was extremely useful for the blog page that holds all of my blogs. Each blog is constructed using a template blog function that is being passed parameters such as the title, image, and contents of the blog thumbnail.</p>
      <div class="blog-img-container">
        <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog_builder.png" alt="Image Text">
      </div>
      <p>I also found it very useful for other repetitive systems, such as the 3D engine setup for Three.js, the navigation bar, the gallery builder (similar to the blog builder), and as my project scales, so too will the need for more automation.</p>
      <p>Another thing I have really been enjoying is the 3D aspect. Currently, this is only limited to the front page as the gallery is not quite finished yet. Currently it only spins around the model in a preset format, random model on website visit, and allows for going back and forth between models.</p>
      <p>The plans are to add the following features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Change Material from a selection in real-time</li>
        <li>Free-move the camera around the model</li>
        <li>Show/Hide Wireframe</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Outside of this project, I have been working on other projects that I am looking forward to showcasing in future. This includes a game development project, several tools projects, and a hardware-software project for my own home file server, media center, and database host.</p>
      <p>Overall, I am really looking forward to further developing this site, expanding my knowledge of webdev, and showcasing more of my many projects.</p>
