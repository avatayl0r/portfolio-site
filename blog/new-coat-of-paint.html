        <p>It has been a while since my last blog post, and in that time I have been busy with loads of different projects.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, many of these projects are under NDA, however a few I can share are as follows.</p>
        <div class="blog-img-container">

        <p>Firstly, I've been branching out into meaningful app development to improve User Experience with day-to-day applications such as building a fast tool for multimedia viewing, metadata editing, and sorting.</p>
        <p>I call it GGF Media Viewer (GGF-MV) and I am super excited to unveil it as a FOSS project. The goal is to continue to build a fast and easy-to-use multimedia viewer, and to improve it with unique features.</p>
        <div class="blog-img-container">
            <img class="blog-img" src="template-image-2.jpg" alt="Image Text">
        </div>
        <p>Next, I have been delving more into hardware-software work and experimenting with Linux.</p>
        <p>I've really been enjoying it, and I'm looking forward to a future project involving building my own low-cost portable computer.</p>
        <div class="blog-img-container">
            <img class="blog-img" src="template-image-3.jpg" alt="Image Text">
        </div>
        <p>Finally, I have been working on improving this website with a massive overhaul. The system is a lot more modern and sleek, and I hope to improve it further in the coming weeks.</p>
