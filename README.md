# Portfolio Site

## Overview

Hello, World! This is my portfolio site, and my first ever feature complete site built from scratch using JavaScript, NodeJS, ThreeJS, HTML, and CSS.

I aim to use this site for showcasing my work, updating and logging my resume, having a somewhat reflective about me section, a blog for blogging my various development projects, and a gallery of my 3D models, texturing, materials, shaders, and more.

The site is still early in development, and will be consistently being updated.

## Features

- **3D Rendering**: A 3D Rendering Engine in-browser.

- **Blog**: A Blog Platform for Sharing My Works and Progress.

- **Galleries & Projects**: Much of my work (that is not NDA) is hosted here!
